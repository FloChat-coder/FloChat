# Privacy Policy for FloChat

**Last Updated: [May 26, 2025]**

This Privacy Policy describes how FloChat ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our chatbot service integrated with Facebook Messenger ("Service").

## Information We Collect

When you interact with our Service on Facebook Messenger, we may receive the following information provided by Facebook or directly by you:

*   **User ID:** Your Facebook User ID associated with the conversation.
*   **Message Content:** The content of the messages you send to the Service.
*   **Timestamps:** The time and date of your messages.

Our Service also interacts with Google Sheets and the Google Gemini API to retrieve product information and generate responses. We do not store your personal conversation data from Facebook Messenger within these Google services beyond the temporary processing required to generate a response.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

*   Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.
*   Respond to your inquiries and messages.
*   Improve and personalize our Service.
*   If an owner manually replies to a query that the bot could not answer, the original query and the owner's reply may be stored to improve the bot's future responses. This stored information will consist of the question text and the answer text, not directly linked to your specific User ID in the long-term learning data.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except as necessary to provide the Service (e.g., sending data to the Google Gemini API for response generation).

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Your Choices

You can stop interacting with our Service at any time by ceasing to send messages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
